# Oil Reserve Prediction – OilyGiant  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project helps an oil company identify which region has the highest potential profit when developing new wells.  

Using a **linear regression model**, we analyzed exploration data across 3 regions and selected the most profitable one considering:  
- Drilling costs.  
- Estimated reserve volume.  
- Risk of financial loss.  

## 🎯 Results  
- Identified the region with the **highest expected profit margin**.  
- Reduced **loss risk below 2.5%**.  
- Supported safer and more profitable investment decisions.  

## 🛠️ Technologies  
Linear regression + bootstrapping  
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib.  

## 📊 Business Impact  
The model helps the company invest in wells with **maximum profitability and minimum risk**, optimizing exploration budgets.
